## bye

My name is Juan Antonio Ruz, I'm 38 years old, live in Spain and in a self-taught way I started to develop more than 10 years ago ...

This is my very summarised experience since 2006:

**JEE (2006/2012)**: during this time I was highly focused in JEE, working on companies (Hewlett Packard - Senior Programmer) and as a freelance developer and consultant. I worked with following patterns MVC, ORM and DI implemented on different frameworks (Struts, JSF, EJB3, Hibernate, Spring, Seam,  ...). From my java beginning, I always tried to develop with TDD and XP methodologies and was very passionate in Event and Aspect Oriented Programming. I worked as JavaEE teacher too, on private and public companies (+ 1500 Hours) 

**RoR/js (2011/2013)**: Looking forward to do a bit creative and experimental programming I decided to migrate to dynamic languages (RoR, js) and data visualization (processing.org, openlayers, d3.js) lands

**js/Clojure/ClojureScript (2012/2013)**:  I teleworked with [enterpriseweb.com](http://enterpriseweb.com/) a New York company doing a lot of js (nodejs, requirejs, jquery, jasmine, D3 ...), clojure and clojurescript. During this time I had to get familiar with big data concepts and concurrent patterns. That's the reasong that I have some background on hadoop, zookeeper, solr, mongodb, accumulo and related clojure libs (liebke/zookeeper-clj, liebke/avout, nathanmarz/cascalog, alexott/clojure-hadoop) 

**Clojure/ClojureScript (2010/now)**: I discovered clojure with [quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) (clojure on top of [processing.org](http://processing.org/)). From then, my fascination about its LISP features including the community never ends. 
This 2014 I got the chance to work with juxt.pro


Among my last clojure projects Iâ€™ve developed there are an [open-stack](https://www.openstack.org/) clojure rest [wrapper](https://github.com/tangrammer/open-stack-wrapper) , a snmp4j clojure rest wrapper , and a open-stack clojurescript - om.clj - react.js UI [client](https://github.com/tangrammer/open-stack-ui).


I usually try to integrate core.async and core.logic, and currently I'm focusing on swannodette/om. 
I attach also some video examples to show superficially my current interests on clojurescript and client side development. 

This [video](http://vimeo.com/89089056) shows my own solution to achieve brepl live editing behavior, the same as clojurescriptone,  using the React/OM framework. The pattern used here communicates the components, in a core.async/CSP manner, putting a map of channels into the component channel. Using this pattern, the developer  can mix mock with real data and move between the different states of the app, only reevaluating the code on emacs (brepl + cemerick/austin) 

And this other [video](http://vimeo.com/89089056) shows a previous js experiment project that was built thinking on async compose processes (pipelines), events and aspects. This framework lets swap coding (hot reloading code without browser reload) in dev mode. This feature is built on top of requirejs, socket.io and nodemon. The AOP/EOP orientation of this framework lets you easy filter the internal processes(pipelines) to make logging on the terminal, profiling or doing d3 process [visualisations](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8688858/folding_unfolding_pipelines.mov) ([static image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8688858/desktop.png))



I used to post my favorites on
